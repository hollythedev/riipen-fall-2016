Created by Holly, Jon and Ringo

For this project, we made a website through WordPress for our client, Riipen. We used Javascript, Jquery, CSS and HTML elements to develop the site. Not only is the site designed with a mobile-first approach (responsive), but it also contains motions such as parallax scrolling and animations.

Through this assignment, we learned how to utizlise GIT branches and Migrate DB Pro to a greter extent. As one of our first group projects, this assignment also allowed us to learn how to work as a team.
