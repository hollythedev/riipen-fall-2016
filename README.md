Created by [Holly Cheng](https://github.com/dumplinghub), [Jonathan Funk](https://github.com/jonathanfunk)and [Ringo Ng](https://github.com/ringong95).

For this project, we made a website through WordPress for our client, Riipen. We used Javascript, Jquery, CSS and HTML elements to develop the site. Not only is the site designed with a mobile-first approach (responsive), but it also contains motions such as parallax scrolling and animations.

Through this assignment, we learned how to utizlise GIT branches and Migrate DB Pro to a greter extent. As one of our first group projects, this assignment also allowed us to learn how to work as a team.

##Plugins

We used multiple plugins to expand on the functionality of the website.

### Custom Field Suite (CFS)

By using CFS, we are able to build a path for the client to dynamically insert content depending on their needs.

### Wp Post Carousel (WPC)

We used WPC to create a carousel of custom post types and to display them where ever needed.

### Riipen Functionality

A custom plugin built by us using the post type generator. It enables the client to create custom posts with special input feilds tailored to the client's needs. 

Functionality and designs are customized in a way that provides the client with full flexibility, thus allowing them to manage the site in an intuitive manner.
